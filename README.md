Positive integer numInsects is read from input. Organize the lines of code to create a while loop that executes while numInsects is less than 200. In each iteration:  Print numInsects followed by a space. Update numInsects with numInsects multiplied by 2. After the loop, print a newline.  Ex: If the input is 16, then the output is:  16 32 64 128
